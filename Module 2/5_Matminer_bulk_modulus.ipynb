To find such relations, we need to \"featurize\" the input data such that they are numbers that meaningfully represent the underlying physical quantity. For example, one \"feature\" or \"descriptor\" of the composition of a material such as ``Nb4CoSi`` would be the standard deviation of the Pauling electronegativity of the elements in the compound (weighted by stoichiometry). Compositions with high values of this quantity would be more ionic and quantities with lower values would tend towards covalent or ionic. A descriptor of the crystal structure might be the average coordination number of sites; higher coordination numbers indicate more bonds and therefore might indicate stiffer materials. With matminer, we can start generating hundreds of possible descriptors using the descriptor library that is available. Data mining techniques can help narrow down which descriptors are the most relevant to the target problem using the available output data as a guide."
